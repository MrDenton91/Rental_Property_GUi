# Rental Property Analysis with GUi

## Abstract
Given rental listings on craiglist.com, I simply would to give the operator the abillity to look at the average and medium prices of those properties listed. I allowed the user to check which attributes apply to there property for a more acurate price range.
* Calculate the price per squarfoot.

## Results
So long as the user has a stable intnet connection and chooses a reasonable range around thier zipcode(5 miles - 20 miles), results will be ready in about 5 minutes.
* Current program can yield results from anywhere in the United States 

### Improvements
* I'm not a front end developer as such this the UI can be vastly improved.
* Create a file that stores pasts search results on the users local machine.
